== Welcome to Rails

This is a cross-validation tool for some scientific work I'm doing.

Data is stored in matrices consisting of cells and empty rows. Empty columns could be added fairly easily, but they weren't useful for my purposes.

In my case, I have a tool (proprietary) which predicts values in some columns based on similarity to other columns. So, for two matrices (A,B), you'd look at each column in A and try to find a similar column in B -- then use that to predict missing values in A.

The problem -- generically -- is that it's not known exactly what is missing. We can usually simulate the tool's ability to predict new values by removing known values and trying to predict them back, provided there isn't some sort of ascertainment bias for the data.

There are many ways to remove known values for validation of positive predictive ability. In this case, we're using n-fold cross-validation in one or two stages. You drop out 1/nth of the values in the matrix and try to predict them back; then repeat for each other unique 1/nth-sized set.

I began with the idea that it could be general-purpose (e.g., applicable to other problems), and have tried not to restrict the matrices to a specific type of information. I suspect this could be quite useful for determining how politicians might vote given past votes. It might also be useful for gene expression if the boolean matrix is changed to a numeric type.

Once published, I'll talk about what we're using it for.
